# Ollama Quantized Tuning Manager - Project Summary

## Overview

Ollama Manager is a comprehensive Python-based terminal application that provides a beautiful and intuitive interface for managing Ollama models and parameters. The tool helps users optimize model performance based on their system capabilities and visualizes memory usage before and after parameter changes.

## Key Features

### 1. System Analysis and Recommendations

The application analyzes the user's system specs (CPU, RAM, GPU) and provides tailored recommendations for:
- Appropriate model sizes
- Optimal quantization levels
- Context window sizes
- Flash attention settings
- KV cache configurations

### 2. Memory Visualization

Memory usage is tracked and visualized before and after model runs, showing:
- System RAM usage
- Process memory consumption
- Memory impact of different parameter settings
- Visual comparisons with progress bars

### 3. Ollama Model Management

Users can:
- Search the Ollama model library
- View details about available models
- Pull new models to their system
- Create custom model configurations with specific parameters

### 4. Parameter Fine-tuning

The application provides an intuitive interface for configuring:
- Quantization levels (Q4_0, Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q6_K, Q8_0)
- Flash Attention toggle
- KV Cache type selection (auto, f16, f32)
- Context window size adjustment

### 5. Rich Terminal UI

The interface features:
- Color-coded panels and tables
- Progress bars for memory visualization
- Interactive menus for easy navigation
- Detailed system information display

### 6. Configuration Management

User preferences and presets are saved and managed for:
- Default parameter settings
- Recently used models
- Custom model configurations
- UI preferences

## Implementation Details

### UI and Visualization

The application uses the Rich library to create a beautiful terminal UI with:
- Formatted tables
- Progress bars
- Panels
- Color-coded text
- Live updates

### Ollama Integration

Interaction with Ollama is handled through:
- REST API calls for model management
- Subprocess calls for model execution
- Modelfile generation for parameter configuration

### Memory Analysis

Memory tracking is implemented using:
- psutil for system resource monitoring
- Before/after snapshots of memory usage
- Difference calculation and visualization
- Impact analysis and recommendations

### Configuration

User settings are managed through:
- JSON configuration files
- Cross-platform configuration directories
- Default settings with user customization

### Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:
- API communication failures
- Missing dependencies
- Invalid configurations
- System resource limitations

## Usage Flow

1. System analysis to understand hardware capabilities
2. Model search and selection based on system constraints
3. Parameter configuration with guidance from recommendations
4. Memory snapshots before running the model
5. Model execution with the configured parameters
6. Memory impact analysis
7. Parameter adjustment based on results

## Extensions and Future Work

Possible extensions include:
- Support for model fine-tuning
- Batch processing of multiple prompts
- Performance benchmarking across different configurations
- Integration with other LLM frameworks beyond Ollama
- GPU memory monitoring for systems with discrete GPUs
